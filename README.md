## Rules 🛑

Admittedly, not many. Let loose your inner creative freak! <br/>
But... Adhere to these at least.<br/>

* Do not create scenes you wouldn't put on your portfolio - keep it pegi 16.
* Do not create scenes outside of the dedicated "src/scenes" folder.
* Do not override anything other than main in your scenes custom css.
* Do not make changes in other peoples scenes unless explicit permission exists.
* Do not change the default css file (as a result of your scene) PR'ing improvements is fine.
* Do not change the tsconfig file.
