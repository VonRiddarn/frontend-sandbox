# ðŸ’» frontend-sandbox ðŸŽ­ðŸŽ®
Web based project sandbox for all made in typescript by some frontend students<br/>
A place to post weird crazy ideas and projects!<br/>
Link to live project will be added when availible.

## How to use ðŸ“–
*Note: this project is under construction and does not yet work. <br/> 
things written here are merely ideas and plans, and should be interpreted as such.*

It's easy, really! <br/>
Just create a module that inherits from the ModuleBehavior class and add a new instance <br/>
of that module to the statemachine initializer. <br/>
From there the statemachine will handle adding your button to the sidebar and make the necessary state calls through your module.<br/>

## Rules ðŸ›‘

Admittedly, not many. Let loose your inner creative freak! <br/>
But... Adhere to these at least.<br/>

* Do not create modules outside of the dedicated "src/modules" folder.
* Do not override anything other than main in your modules custom css.
* Do not make changes in other peoples modules unless explicit permission exists.
* Do not change the default css file.
* Do not change the tsconfig file.

## ðŸŽŠ That's it! ðŸŽŠ
